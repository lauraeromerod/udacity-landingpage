# Landing Page Project 

In this project, you will find a landing page displaying four sections which can be accessed by clicking on the dynamically created navigation or by scrolling through the page. 
When a section is visible or it's in the viewport, a random linear gradient background is added to specify that the section is active, and the navigation link will also have a black background.
The navigation bar will be hidden when you're not scrolling. 
A return to top button will appear when scrolling below the hero.
