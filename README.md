# Landing Page Project

In this project, you will find a landing page displaying four sections.

## Features

- Each section can be accessed by clicking on the dynamically created navigation or by scrolling through the page.
- When a section is visible or it's in the viewport, a random linear gradient background is added to specify that the section is active, and the navigation link will also have a black background.
- The navigation bar will be hidden when you're not scrolling.
- When scrolling below the hero, a return to top button will appear.
